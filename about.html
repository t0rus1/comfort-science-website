The beanbags you see on our web site are not the ones you can buy on the side of the road. We make beanbags which you can be proud of owning, look good and are very comfy.

Furthermore, the outer cover is removable and washable. You may also purchase additional covers from us.

WHAT'S INSIDE? ... NEITHER BEANS NOR BEADS!
Our bean bags are filled with shredded flexible polyurethane foam (which is the same stuff a foam mattress is made of).
